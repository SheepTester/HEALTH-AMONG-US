# Start creating the React app

This project is bootstrapped using the [Create React app] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available scripts

In the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Run the application in development mode. \
To view it in your browser, open [http: // localhost: 3000] (http: // localhost: 3000).

When you make changes, the page will reload. \
You may also find any lint errors on the console.

### `npm Test`

Start the test runner in interactive viewing mode. \
See the [Running Tests] section (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.

### `npm Run Build`

Build the build application into the 'Build' folder. \
It responds well to production mode and optimizes build for better performance.

The build is minimized and the hash is included in the file name. \
Your app is ready to deploy!

See the section on [Deployment] (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for details.

### `npm Run Popup`

** Note: This is a one way operation. Once you are `kicked out`, you can not go back! **

If you are not satisfied with your build tools and configuration choices you can always "opt out". This command removes a single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you complete control over them. All commands except 'eject` will still work, but you can change them as they point to the copied script. At this point, you are your own.

You do not have to use Eject. The curated feature set is ideal for small and medium layouts, and you do not have to feel obligated to use this feature. However, we know that this tool is useless if you can not customize it when you are ready.
